### DynamoDB Method For Interaction

I used all the methods in different files so we can use that files
as a lambda function as well.

#### Steps to Test These Things

- Create A Table at DynamoDB with "Friends" Table.
- Create a role from IAM to allow lambda function to access DynamoDB. (If lambda Function use)
- Create Lambda Function of different DynamoDB Operations.
